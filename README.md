## Description

PhishiUrl is designed to help identify and mitigate potential phishing attacks that exploit Unicode characters. These attacks can trick users by using domain names that look visually similar to legitimate ones but are, in fact, malicious. PhishiUrl generates these deceptive URLs, checks their availability, and tests their connection status, making it a valuable tool for cybersecurity analysis.

## Features

- **Generate Phishing URLs:** Generate potential phishing URLs by replacing characters in a domain with visually similar Unicode characters.
- **Check Domain Availability:** Verify whether the generated domains are available for registration.
- **Connection Status Check:** Test the connection status of the generated URLs to see if they are reachable.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Option to output results to a file for detailed analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
